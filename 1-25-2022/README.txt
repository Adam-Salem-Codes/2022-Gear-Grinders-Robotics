*************************************************************** CODE EXPLAINING ***************************************************************
Hello, alot has changed in the past months. We have switched to full C++ and it has made my life 10x easier.
Let me explain my code, the drive and turn methods are an easier way of writing Drivetrain.turnFor(); and drive.
The multitask method is ran at the same time as autonomous so you could drive and use the treads at the same time also this method doesn't
do much yet but will come in handy later also the multitaskrunning Boolean is true when the multitask method is run and false when driver control is called.
Its hard to explain in words what the autonomous does, so i'll upload a picture of its path so you can better understand it.
